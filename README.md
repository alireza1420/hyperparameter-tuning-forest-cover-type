# hyperparameter-tuning-forest-cover-type
This project demonstrates a scalable approach to hyperparameter tuning for a RandomForestClassifier using Ray Tune and Grid Search. The goal is to identify the optimal model configuration for classifying forest cover types based on the Covertype dataset (retrieved via sklearn.datasets.fetch_covtype).
